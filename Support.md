# ChefGrocer Support

Welcome to the official support page for **ChefGrocer**, your voice-powered kitchen command center. Whether you're scanning groceries, setting timers, or exploring premium features, we’re here to help.

## Common Questions

**How do I scan a barcode?**  
Tap the barcode icon on the home screen and grant camera access. Hold the item steady and let ChefGrocer do the rest.

**Why isn’t voice working?**  
Make sure microphone permissions are enabled in Settings. For best results, speak clearly and avoid background noise.

**Can I use ChefGrocer offline?**  
Core features like timers and calculators work offline. Barcode scanning and voice commands require internet access.

**How do I manage my subscription?**  
Go to Settings → Subscription. You can upgrade, cancel, or restore purchases anytime.

## Troubleshooting

- App crashing? Try restarting your device and reinstalling ChefGrocer.  
- Barcode not recognized? Some items may not be in our database yet—we’re expanding daily.  
- Voice delay? Check your internet connection and retry.
